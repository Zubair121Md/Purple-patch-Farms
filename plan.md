# üçá Fruit & Vegetable Cost Allocation System

## Phase 1 ‚Äî Understanding the Problem (Very Simple)

You sell fruits and vegetables.

Some you grow yourself (inhouse), some you buy from market (outsourced).

Every month, costs happen:

Buying, cultivating, marketing, loading/unloading, truck fees, wastage‚Ä¶

Each product has different quantity & price every month.

Goal: Figure out how much each product costs and your profit automatically.

Challenge: Shared costs like loading trucks or marketing should be split fairly.

Analogy:
Imagine you bought candies for a party and shared the cost among friends according to how many candies each friend got. Same idea here, but for fruits and vegetables.

## Phase 2 ‚Äî Decide What We Need

We need 4 things:

Products ‚Äì info about fruits/veggies

Name, source (inhouse/outsourced), unit (kg), extra info

Monthly Sales ‚Äì how much we sold each month

Quantity, sale price, direct cost (like purchase cost or cultivation cost)

Costs ‚Äì all the money we spent

Name, amount, which products it applies to (inhouse/outsourced/all), type (purchase-only, sales-only, common), month, fixed or variable

Allocations ‚Äì calculated cost share for each product

Example: Strawberry loading ‚Çπ85.71, Banana ‚Çπ214.29

DSA Tip:

Use dictionaries/maps to look up products quickly.

Use arrays/lists to store monthly data.

Use prefix sums if you want to compute cumulative cost efficiently.

## Phase 3 ‚Äî Data Structures (Simple Explanation)

We can store info like this:

Products
products = {
  1: {"name":"Strawberry", "source":"outsourced"},
  2: {"name":"Banana", "source":"outsourced"},
  3: {"name":"Apple", "source":"inhouse"}
}

Monthly Sales
monthly_sales = {
  "2025-10": {
    1: {"qty":10, "sale_price":200, "direct_cost":1500},
    2: {"qty":25, "sale_price":150, "direct_cost":2000},
    3: {"qty":30, "sale_price":100, "direct_cost":0}
  }
}

Costs
costs = {
  "2025-10": [
    {"name":"Purchase Loading", "amount":300, "applies_to":"outsourced", "basis":"weight"},
    {"name":"Sales Loading", "amount":700, "applies_to":"both", "basis":"weight"}
  ]
}

DSA tip:

Use hashmaps (dict) for O(1) lookup of product info.

Use arrays/lists to loop over costs for allocation.

## Phase 4 ‚Äî Allocation Logic (The Core)

Step 1: Decide which products are affected

purchase-only ‚Üí only outsourced

sales-only ‚Üí all sold products

inhouse-only ‚Üí only inhouse

common ‚Üí all products

Step 2: Compute total "basis"

If basis = weight ‚Üí sum of product quantities for that cost

If basis = value ‚Üí sum of (qty * sale_price)

If basis = trips ‚Üí sum of trips info (for trucks)

Step 3: Allocate cost proportionally
For each product:

share = (product_qty / total_qty) * cost_amount

Store share in allocation table/dictionary.

Step 4: Compute total cost per product

total_cost = direct_cost + sum(allocated_costs)
cost_per_kg = total_cost / qty
profit = (qty * sale_price) - total_cost

DSA tip:

Using maps to store product ‚Üí allocation makes it fast.

For large data, you can use prefix sums to compute cumulative costs efficiently.

## Phase 5 ‚Äî Example Calculation (Very Simple)

Input:

Purchase Loading ‚Çπ300 for outsourced items:

Strawberry 10kg

Banana 25kg

Sales Loading ‚Çπ700 for all sold items:

Strawberry 10kg (outsourced)

Banana 25kg (outsourced)

Apple 30kg (inhouse)

Step 1: Purchase Loading Allocation

Total qty = 10 + 25 = 35kg

Strawberry: 10/35 * 300 = 85.71

Banana: 25/35 * 300 = 214.29

Step 2: Sales Loading Allocation

Total qty = 10 + 25 + 30 = 65kg

Strawberry: 10/65 * 700 = 107.69

Banana: 25/65 * 700 = 269.23

Apple: 30/65 * 700 = 323.08

Step 3: Total Allocation per Product

Strawberry = 85.71 + 107.69 = 193.40

Banana = 214.29 + 269.23 = 483.52

Apple = 323.08

## Phase 6 ‚Äî Monthly Workflow

Add products (name, source)

Add monthly sales (qty, sale price, direct cost)

Add monthly costs (amount, type, basis)

Run allocation engine ‚Üí system calculates allocations automatically

View monthly report ‚Üí cost per product, profit, cost/kg, source-wise summary

DSA Tip:

Sorting products by name or source can help quickly generate reports.

Use heap/priority queue if you want top profitable products fast.

## Phase 7 ‚Äî Reports and Insights

Monthly product cost sheet

Profit per product

Inhouse vs Outsourced P&L

Expense breakdown by category

Export CSV/Excel

## Phase 8 ‚Äî Advanced DSA Usage

HashMap / Dictionary ‚Üí O(1) product lookup

Prefix sum / cumulative sum ‚Üí fast cost aggregation

Sorting ‚Üí rank products by cost/kg or profit

Weighted allocation formula ‚Üí optimize cost sharing

share = (product_qty * weight) / sum(product_qty * weight) * cost_amount

## Phase 9 ‚Äî Backend & API

Endpoints:

Add/Edit/Delete Products, Monthly Sales, Costs

Allocate costs for a month

Fetch allocation tables and reports

Sample API Calls

POST /products ‚Üí add product

POST /monthly_sales ‚Üí add sales

POST /costs ‚Üí add cost

POST /allocate?month=2025-10 ‚Üí run allocation

GET /report/monthly?month=2025-10 ‚Üí view report

## Phase 10 ‚Äî Frontend

Forms for Products, Sales, Costs

Button: "Allocate Costs"

Display table: per-product cost + profit

Graphs: Profit by product, Inhouse vs Outsourced

## Phase 11 ‚Äî Edge Cases

Zero qty ‚Üí skip allocation

Partial season ‚Üí only allocate to available products

Fixed costs ‚Üí auto copy to next months

Wastage ‚Üí cost entry or adjust qty

## Phase 12 ‚Äî Step-By-Step Execution

Add products

Add monthly sales

Add costs

Run allocation

View reports

Export CSV/Excel

## üìå Notes for Cursor

Implement backend first (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy)

Use dicts/maps for fast product & allocation lookups

Apply DSA techniques for cumulative totals & weighted allocation

Test example: Strawberry, Banana, Apple with loading/unloading costs
